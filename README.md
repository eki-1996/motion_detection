motion detection using ip camera
this program capture pictures from your ip camera through RSTP, try to find the difference of two pictures using opencv. Once get difference over your limitation(the size of difference), then it save that picture in your PC, and send a message and the picture to your line account.

In order to achive it, you need get your own line notify, an ip camera and a computer.(if you're using laptop or desktop, you can choose 1080p stream, but if you are using resiberry pi, I'm sorry that it just can not hold 1080p(cause some bad pictures occur), you may need to choose 720p or 360p)
