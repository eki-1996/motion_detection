motion detection using ip camera
this program capture picture from your ip camera through RSTP, try to find the difference of two pictures using opencv. Once get difference to your limitation, then it save that picture in your PC, and send a message and the picture to your line account.

In order to achive it, you need get your own line notify, a ip camera and a computer.(if you use laptop or desktop, you can choose 1080p stream, but if you are using resiberry pi, I'm sorry that it just can hold 1080p(cause some bad picture occurs), you should choose 720p or 360p)
